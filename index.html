               <h3>STUDY 1:  SLEEPING WITH PLUSH TOYS:</h3>
               <p>You might have your owl watching you or a rabbit near you, and you might think that it helps. There are a lot of studies confirming that it helps, but it is not the most effective way. You might wonder why. They can bring you some comfort in your life, but it's not the same as having a living person next to you. <br /> Just imagine that you have a person in your life that you like. Now imagine he likes you as well. And now imagine that he would be there instead of a rabbit. Do you think that it would make a difference? If you don't think that, then please read the next study.</p>

               <h3>STUDY 2: SLEEPING WITH A PERSON YOU LIKE:</h3>
               <p>If you weren't convinced by our study 1, then you surely will be convinced now. We conducted a lot of studies and determined that the best way to sleep safe and better is if you jump into the arms of a person you like. You can hug him, and he can hug you as well. From that moment on, you would forget all the problems, and you will feel relaxed and safe. Your quality of life would increase by 100%. <br /> You could stay in his arms for as long as you would want to. Your plush toys might be jealous, but they would understand as you would feel better. <i>This study is confirmed by Hedwig, Hummingbirds, and the rabbit. </i> </p>

               <h3>STUDY 3: THE BEST PLACE</h3>
               <p>After reading, you are probably already convinced. However, the question is, how and where? If you don't know the answer, then don't worry, because we've got you covered! We conducted a lot of studies in this area as well. But for now, we will stick to studies in Germany. To feel and sleep better in the next weeks, first, we recommend going on a trip with the person you like! We can promise you one thing: It will be an unforgettable memory! In this case, we recommend two places: ULM and HEILBRONN. Both of them offer the same. Heilbronn, however, might be closer. If you decide to make a trip and if it rains, then don't worry! You can also stay in a hotel on a huge bed together with him (if you bring a plush toy with you, make sure to leave it on the other bed). <br /> Now you might wonder what will you do... but one thing we can guarantee you: Once you are in his arms, you will be the happiest person on this world. All you have to do is relax.</p>
